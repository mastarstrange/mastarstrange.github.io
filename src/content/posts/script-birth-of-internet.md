Internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and live. This technology was a result of the collective efforts of many individuals. This essay summarizes the contributions of some of the critical players involved in the creation and evolution of the internet.

Vinton G. "Vint" Cerf and Robert E. "Bob" Kahn developed the TCP/IP protocol, which is the foundation of the internet. In 1973, they proposed a way to transmit data between computers using packet switching networks. Their idea was adopted by the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) and later by the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET), which formed the backbone of the modern-day internet${[3]}$. Another important player in the early days of the internet was Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web in 1989. His invention created an explosion of digital content and made the internet accessible to millions of people.

Other notable figures in the development of the internet include David Clark from MIT, who implemented compact TCP to run in PCs, and Leonard Kleinrock, who published the first book on ARPANET in 1976${[4]}$, and Bob Metcalfe developed ethernet technology in 1973, and Lawrence G. Roberts, who helped create the ARPANET, and Paul Baran, who did the packet-switching design. J.C.R. Licklider, who developed the idea of a universal network. David J. Farber, who helped organize the major American research networks CSNET, NSFNET, and NREN${[1]}$. The list goes on with many more pioneers who helped in shaping the modern internet we know today.

In conclusion, the contributions of Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn were critical to the creation of TCP/IP protocol, while Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web made the internet more accessible to the masses. Together with all the pioneers from the "Birth of the Internet" plaque and "Internet Hall of Fame"${[2]}$, they created one of the most significant inventions in modern history, which has transformed the world we live in today.
