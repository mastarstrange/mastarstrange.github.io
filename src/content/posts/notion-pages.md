## update

i've since moved my note taking offline to markdown and obsidian. so there is a possibility the links might not work.
most of the info and more will be available in the soon-to-come wiki page.

## exposition

you might or might not know that, i collect notes and write stuff at notion. the following are some of the public links for the content i have accumulated on notion over the years and don't have the time to bother porting them over to markdown (yet).
don't expect too much. some are incomplete.

do what you will. hope it serves some use to you.
