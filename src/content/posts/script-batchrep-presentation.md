## script
A very good morning to everyone here. I'm here to utilize a few minutes to let you know a little about me. So please kindly bear with me for some time.
I am Thuvaragan Sooriyakumaran, in case you haven't figured it out yet, This is me when I was a cherished high schooler, sadly I couldn't find any portraits from my time at UOM, and I hope to not use that excuse anymore from today.

So a brief history about me, I was born in Colombo in 2001, but I lived in Jaffna. I was the student of the year in 2010 in my Primary School. I spent most of my life from 2012 to 2020 in my secondary school, apart from usual clubs and achievements, I was in the Scouts and I was in the Board of Prefects for the year 2019, in the meantime I also cherished my role as a president in the English Union in the year 2019. In the year 2020, during the pandemic, among several difficulties, I was selected as the senior prefect of the school. I tried my best to support the school during that time. Then I sat for the GCE AL exams and got into University of Moratuwa, Engineering Faculty. In the meantime I was also following some internships from the contacts I got from school and some post school courses I did. I am also currently following CIMA from CGMA

Moreover, from the time I got selected to the university, I've been a part of activities like Mora Exams 2021, Thamizharuvi 2022, and some sports festivals. Among them, the Mora Bash 2023 was a cherished memory, There weren't many events that encompasses all of the batch during the first semester, so this was a gift. I specially helped, planned and organized the decorations with my friends and am super proud of it.

I've also been a part of AIESEC - CS Marketing & Digital team and contributed in ways I could in the first term, now I'm joining them again. And I'm also an active member of Hiking Club, Carom Club, IEEE and Tamil Literary Association.

Furthermore, I'm a person with selective worlds if not few, and I can plan and organize tasks and projects in a fly. I like listening to people's opinions and understanding their perception. I'm patient and can adapt my mindset according to the situation. 
Even though I can do speeches under pressure I lack the forwardness to start them on my own, it's like if there is no need, I would feel like I've disturbed someone if I present myself. I am bad at timing my personal life and maintaining my health at an optimum level.

Finally my ask is an opportunity to connect with and guide along all the different colleagues from my batch with a sense of belonging and the mutual ability to develop ourselves along the way.

Looking back all the hardships we have faced to return to this sort of normal situation in a physical environment and to think that I got an opportunity to be considered to represent my colleagues, I'm truly grateful for this opportunity and can't wait to see what comes next in life. Always strive to be better and neverssettle.
