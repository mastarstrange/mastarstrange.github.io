## just do it

if you are planning to do some deep learning, just do it. don't worry about the framework. both tensorflow and pytorch are great. just pick one and start coding. that's what some sensible people might say. even i would say that if not for my ocd. but before i start this rather long very informative post about two of the contenders in the deep learning space, it wouldn't be right to not set the record straight by saying just start with something.

> pytorch would be a good choice for a beginner, the important thing is to start and grab the main concepts then it wouldn't matter which framework, you've got world class generative tools at your disposal, it will be a breeze to switch from one to the other.

now that i've got that out of the way, and the only reason you would keep on reading would be non other than my charming personality, let's get to the crux of the matter.

## the age old dilemma

pytorch created my the ai research team at facebook and tensorflow by the google brain team. ah now we see the problem. both are open source and have a huge community. both are great for deep learning. but which one is better? well, it depends on what you are looking for. let's take a look at some of the differences between the two.

## pytorch

pytorch is a python based library that provides maximum flexibility and speed. it is a dynamic computation graph framework which means that you can change the graph on the fly. this makes it easier to debug and experiment with. it is also easier to learn and use. it is great for research and prototyping

## tensorflow

tensorflow is a static computation graph framework which means that you have to define the graph before you run it. this makes it harder to debug and experiment with. it is also harder to learn and use. it is great for production and deployment.

## conclusion

so which one is better? well, it depends on what you are looking for. if you are looking for maximum flexibility and speed, then pytorch is the way to go. if you are looking for production and deployment, then tensorflow is the way to go. but in the end, it doesn't really matter. both are great and you can't go wrong with either one. so just pick one and start coding. that's what some sensible people might say. even i would say that if not for my ocd. but before i start this rather long very informative post about two of the contenders in the deep learning space, it wouldn't be right to not set the record straight by saying just start with something.
