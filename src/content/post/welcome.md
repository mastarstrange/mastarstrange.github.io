## what is this?

every silent person has a loud mind. this is my loud mind. i write about things that i find interesting and i hope you do too. i'm not a professional writer or a blogger. i'm just a guy who likes to write. i hope you enjoy your stay here.

## why now?

i've been writing for a long time now. i've been using notion[^1] to collect my thoughts and stuff but the end goal was publishing, always. i wanted a perfect moment to transition my baby portfolio site to a junk site that i'm proud of. well i don't want to waste any more of my time trying to design the best portfolio ever. i've been putting it off for a long time now. but i'm tired of waiting. so here i am. writing. copying. publishing. for you. for me. for us.

[^1]: [notion](https://www.notion.so/) is made by a bunch of really cool people. it's a project organizer and note manager, it's not exactly my cup of tea but i've been using it for a while now cause i didn't have anything better that suited my needs.
