			hello there, thank you for coming here to my <a class="cactus-link" href="/posts/welcome/"
				>humble abode</a
			>, i'm a curious human being from a small island in a planet called earth.
			<br />
			<br />
			i would like to call myself a wizard with computers and related technologies but you do you and
			decide for yourself. i consider myself lucky enough to design and create some feel good artworks
			and creations when i had the time for it. please don't bother with me if the trouble's not worth
			it, i'm an unlocked closed book with a heavy hard cover. if you wanna surprise me i was born on
			the milk chocolate day.
			<br />
			<br />
			i don't want to ruin your day with all my interests, shuffle through stuff i've done if you wanna
			know a bit.
			<br />
